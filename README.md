# Picto-AI

A simple script that creates a skeleton from a given dancer pose and attempts to turn it into a pictogram using a Blender model.

**Pictogram model by VMMO22**

## Status
‚ö† **Warning:** The script is currently not working as expected. While it successfully creates the skeleton, it fails to generate the pictogram due to issues with Blender rig bone names.

## Features
- ‚úÖ Generates skeleton from dancer pose

## Issues
I'm actively investigating the problem with Blender rig bone names and how they interfere with the script.
